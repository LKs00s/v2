Here's a summary of our conversation so far

We started by addressing an issue where your Google OAuth login was redirecting to localhost3000 instead of your deployed Netlify application. I provided a solution that involved modifying the srclibsupabase.ts and srcApp.tsx files to automatically handle the redirect from localhost to your production URL, ensuring that authentication works correctly across environments.

Following that, you requested the creation of a new web application called Registro de eventos. This application needed to connect to a Google Sheet CSV, display event information, include a multimedia gallery for before and after imagesvideos (with Google Drive URL conversion), and feature a visual comparison interface. I implemented this by creating several new components and services, integrating them into your existing application structure.

Most recently, you reported two issues with the Registro de eventos application

Files were failing to load, showing an Error al cargar el archivo message.
The layout for selecting events was not intuitive, with the list appearing at the top.
I addressed these by

Improving the Google Drive URL conversion logic in srcserviceseventService.ts to correctly handle various URL formats and ensure media files load.
Adjusting the layout of the EventsRegistry page to a more intuitive 3-column structure, making the event list more compact and improving the visual selection of events.
Fixing a ReferenceError fileIdMatch is not defined in the convertGoogleDriveUrl function.
